# Tools
This document describes the tools we use for development.
Agreeing on a common set of tools for development allows us to maintain a high
level of quality, for code and documentation. The following list is
only a suggestion... use common sense if you're in doubt.

## Documentation

* [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is our primary documentation tool.
  Please stick to [GitHub flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
* We use [draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) to create all the graphs in our
  documentation.

## Development

* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) is our development
  environment.
* HÃ†LTH is primarily written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/).
* We use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is our git forge and our PM Platform.
* [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used for UI Mockups
