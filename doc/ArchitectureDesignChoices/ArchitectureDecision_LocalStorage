## How and where do we wish to store User Data

As out apps funcctionality depends on storing user data to track progress
we need to make a decision on where and how we wish to store said data that ensures safety from unauthorised access.


## Options

* Remote Database
* Local Storage

## Decision

Chosen option: "Local Storage". We chose Local Storage because it ensures the data is not directly connected to the internet and physically seperated for each user. Local storage eliminated the risk of large data leaks as there is no central database that contains all user data.
A attack is infeasible as the effort a atacker needed to put in outways the value of the data by far. Local Storage allows the user to have full control over his data and does not need to worry about it getting stolen or sold.


## Status
<!-- final -->

## Consequences
Good because:
  Quick implementation
  No maintanace

Bad because:
  no central overview over all data
  customer support, data recovery, switching to new device becomes more difficult
