# Cleaner Code for the HÆLTH App

As part of improving the code for the HÆLTH app, we've made several adjustments to make it cleaner and easier to maintain.

## 1. Using `LazyColumn` instead of `Column` for Repeated Items
Instead of manually repeating `DailyMealsCard` instances, we've used a `LazyColumn`. This is particularly useful when displaying a list of items, as it only loads the currently visible items, thus improving performance.

### Example:
```kotlin
@Composable
fun DailyMealsLazyList(
meals: List<Meal>,
onMealClick: (Meal) -> Unit
) {
LazyColumn(
contentPadding = PaddingValues(vertical = 8.dp),
modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()
) {
items(meals) { meal ->
DailyMealsCard(
dateText = meal.name,
onClick = { onMealClick(meal) }
)
}
}
}
```
## 2. Converting from static data to dynamic input

Previous versions of the code contained hard-coded values. These were replaced with dynamic data to create a more flexible and extensible structure. For example, the meals list was now passed as an argument to the LazyColumn component instead of being hard-coded.

## 3. Introduction of callback functions for interactive elements

The onClick function of the DailyMealsCard has been adapted to pass a Meal object. This allows the card to be interactive upon click and further process the corresponding Meal object.

Example:
DailyMealsCard(
dateText = meal.name,
onClick = { onMealClick(meal) }
)
## 4. Ensuring the correct data types

A common error was that the list was not correctly recognized when using the LazyColumn function. This error occurred because the list type was incorrect, resulting in an argument type mismatch error. This error was resolved by correctly importing items:

import androidx.compose.foundation.lazy.items
Ensure that the list you pass to items() is correctly defined as a List<Meal> and not a List<Int> or another type.

## 5. Improved Readability and Modularity

By introducing features like LazyColumn and better handling of callback functions, the code has become more modular. These changes make it easier to adapt or extend individual components of the app in the future without having to change the entire structure.

## 6. Increased Performance with LazyColumn

LazyColumn is specifically optimized to handle large amounts of data without preloading the entire list. It renders only the visible items, helping to optimize memory usage and load times.
