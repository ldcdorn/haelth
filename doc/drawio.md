## Export settings
Please export graphs in vector and text based formats,
so that they don't interfere with the operation of git, preferably as `svg`.

Use the following settings to minimize the file size:
- Check `Transparent Background`.
- Set `Appearance` to `Light`.
- Uncheck `Shadow`.
- Uncheck `Include a copy of my diagram`.
- Uncheck `Embed Images`.
- Uncheck `Embed Fonts`.
